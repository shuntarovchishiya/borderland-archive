Decode hint (for solvers):

1) Concatenate all lines of hidden/payload.txt into one base64 string.
2) Base64-decode the full string to recover a JS file (inspect before running).
3) A js path is silent, but it listens.
4) Use a online plateform if needed.
5) All the text you have seen are important.
6) Make sure you dont leave anything behind from where you started...
